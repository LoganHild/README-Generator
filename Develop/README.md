  ## Description
  Easy to use generator for README.md files via the command-line

  ## Installation
  npm i

  ## Usage
  Watch the instructional video! After npm i has installed dependencies, use node index.js to begin the prompts in the command line. Answer each question to create the content of the README.md file. Once all questions are answered a success message will appear in the command line and the README.md file will be added to the application folder. The user can then use the generated file wherever they would like!
